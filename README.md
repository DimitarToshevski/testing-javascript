# JS Testing Fundamentals

This repo contains a small example project demonstrating how to test Vanilla JavaScript using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Setup instructions

In the root folder of the project, run these commands:

1. `npm i` or `npm install` - install global project dependencies
2. `npm start` - start FE and BE

## Running tests

Inside the `front-end` folder, run one of the following commands (they all work the same):

- `npm t`
- `npm test`
- `npm run test`
